üö® **_Please read the following Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) carefully before starting the course_** üö®

## FAQ

### Q1: How do I download the files?

**A:** If you're new to GitHub and just want to download the entire code, hit the green button saying "Code", and then choose the "Download ZIP" option. If you can't see the button (on mobile), use [this link](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course/archive/master.zip) instead.

### Q2: What VSCode theme are you using?

**A:** I use Monokai Pro for all my coding and course production. It's a paid theme (I', **not** affiliated with them), but you can actually use the free demo version forever üòÖ

### Q3: Can I see a final version of the course projects?

**A:** Sure! Here you go:

- [Pig Game](https://pig-game-v2.netlify.app) (DOM Manipulation)
- [Bankist](https://bankist.netlify.app/) (Arrays, Numbers, Dates, Timers. Fake "log in" with user `js` and PIN `1111`)
- [Bankist Site](https://bankist-dom.netlify.app/) (Advanced DOM and Events)
- [Mapty](https://mapty.netlify.app/) (OOP, Geolocation, Project planning)
- [forkify](https://forkify-v2.netlify.app/) (Final advanced project)

### Q4: I want to put these projects in my portfolio. Is that allowed?

**A:** Absolutely! Just make sure you actually built them yourself by following the course, and that you understand what you did. What is **not allowed** is that you create your own course/videos/articles based on this course's content!

### Q5: You mentioned your resources page. Where can I find it?

**A:** It's on Jonas Schmedtmann's website at <http://codingheroes.io/resources>.

### Q6: I'm looking for the old course version (v1) files. Where can I find them?

**A:** They are in this same repo, but in the [v1 branch](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course/tree/v1). So just go to [v1](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course/tree/v1), and download the code from there.
